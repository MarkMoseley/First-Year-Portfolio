			<h3>Hi, I'm Mark!</h3>
				<p>I love being creative and solving problems, occasionally at the same time. I like feeling clever by looking a set of data and finding the hidden messages it contains. I love learning and have gotten pretty good at teaching myself new skills. For example, I made this website by teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I have using Java in my computer science classes and in my own personal projects and have a solid understanding of SQL.</p>

				<p>I recently discovered my love of computer science and am currently working on learning as much as I can through classes at Oregon State University and by self-teaching through text books and working through personal projects. I am currently enrolled in a post-baccalaureate computer science degree through Oregon States Ecampus which allows me a great deal of flexibility when it comes to balancing schoolwork and my career. The program allows me to change the timeline of my education, meaning that if I go full time, I can be done within a year. Or if I find employment, I can cut back on classes and finish my degree in my free time over a couple of years.</p>

				<p>I am currently seeking full time employment, whether it be an internship or an entry level position. If hired, I would make sure to switch into a less time consuming track with my degree in order to make my company my top priority. I invite you to check out my <a href= "Moseley Resume.pdf">Resume</a> and my <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-moseley-201ba464">LinkedIn</a> as well as to take a look at some of my work I have posted in my <a href ="https://github.com/MarkMoseley/First-Year-Portfolio">GitHub</a> account. I would love to hear from you about an opporunity that I may be well suited for. I can be reached at Mmoseley91@gmail.com.</p>

	<h2>Relative Employment History<h2>

	<h3>Agilent Technologies</h3>
	
	<p>I worked as a financial analyst, creating end of month reports for my division and performing cost analyses for new and current projects. As you can see on my resume, I worked there for only a short time. I voluntarily left due to a variety of reasons. This was my first job after finishing my finance degree and going into office life straight from college was a big culture shock to me which led me to believe that it wasn't a good fit. Looking back on it now, I realize that I didn't give myself enough time to mature into the role and I wish I had given it more of a chance than I did. However, I have learned from this mistake and it gave me the opportunity to explore new interests including computer science.</p>

	<h3>PPL Corporation</h3>
	
	<!-- the  &#8217;   part is a safer way of adding a ' -->
	<p>I interned as a business analyst in the information services department, working mostly to improve the current business processes they already had in place. One of my bigger projects was to streamline the reporting processes for the project managers in my division. The system currently in place was a homemade one using Microsoft excel. My supervisor had to go through line by line to make sure the project was on track which was time consuming and was prone to human error. After meeting with the project managers and my supervisor to develop requirements, I went to work to make a standard reporting format so that all the project managers&#8217; reports would be identical and easy to read. I then set up a series of macros and conditional formatting to immediately highlight any indication that the project was not on track. I did this using sentinel cells in the spreadsheet which looked out for certain issues. For example, if the project was listed as 25% complete but had already used 75% of its budget, then the budget-timeline sentinel would become highlighted in red and my supervisor would then know where to look for more information. As I worked on this project, I sent weekly updates to my supervisor to receive feedback on what head liked, didn't like, and what needed changing. I completed similar projects for a few other departments in the company as well as a few miscellaneous smaller tasks. While there, I was exposed to the Agile development cycle and all of the processes to go into it and its advantages and disadvantages compared to the waterfall development cycle.</p>   

	<h3>What I have been doing in the mean time</h3>
	
	<p>Over the past 18 months since leaving my last office job, I have been working towards shifting my career into computer science. Before enrolling in Oregon State&#8217;s online program, I took prerequisite courses at West Chester University working towards a master&#8217;s certificate in web technologies. During my time there I learned about Oregon&#8217;s online program and decided to switch into it.</p>
